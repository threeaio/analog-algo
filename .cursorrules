In this project we are building an interactive Version of the book https://www.analog-algorithm.com/.

It is a book that shows extremely creative ways on how to use grids. Additionaly it shows how to setup new kinds of grids.

Our Application is extremely performant and easy to use.

It is created in deep respect to the extra-ordinary style presented in the book. It is minimal and technical and somes with very own style (1 monostyle-font, three colors: almost black, white, red).

Each page shows a new Variant of a grid. So our application must be extremely modular.
This is the main pricilple here: modularity and reusability!

But do not "invent" usecases or parameters. Ask if you have an idea.

We will produce something great here!
